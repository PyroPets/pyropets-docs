# Debug

A debug page is provided on the PyroPets site.

On this page we can interact with Pyros in a more precise way since we do not have to wait for the confirmation of the transaction. It can be used in 3 ways that would be the following and each one is decoded by a color:

- Violet - call contract (read-only non-payable)

- purple - send to contract (read/write non-payable)

- pink - send to contract (read/write payable)
