# Stoking

New Pyros can be created by stoking.

Pyrogenesis occurs when two Pyros "stoke"(breed).

In order to stoke a dynamic fee of MRX based on donor Generation must be paid to the core contract which is then burned.

Pyros must meet a few requirements to be ready to stoke.

- Hunger full - Pyros must have full hunger of 255 in order to stoke.

- Cooldown complete - Pyros have a cooldown based on the Pyro's generation which must complete before it may stoke again.

- Stoking Fee - A fee paid in MRX which is burned which is based on the highest of the donor's generations must be paid in order to stoke.

- Family - All Gen0 Pyros may stoke with Gen0 Pyros, however outside of that parents may not stoke with their children and siblings and/or half siblings may not stoke.

To Stoke you need two Pryos DonorA "the mother" and DonorB "the father"

You can inherit two traits to the children.

- The eyes, from the mother
- The mouth, from the father
- The color is not an inheritable trait

- Choose a Pyro and go stoke, this pyro will be the DonorB "the father"

- Put the token ID of the pyro with which you want to do the stoke, it will be the DonorA "the mother"

- You have to wait the days of cooldown (NextPyroGenesis)

- **NextPyroGenesis:** is the date which you can call **ignite** on, or after
- **StokingWith:** shows the DonorB
- Pyro is avaible to do others [activities](/tokens/pyro/activities) while you wait **NextPyroGenesis**
