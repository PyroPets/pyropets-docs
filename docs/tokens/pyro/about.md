## **PyroPets (PYRO) token**

[PYRO](http://explorer.metrixcoin.com/mrc721/848b9ec4299dac31d21c5db87add813d0cfc58c5/) is an MRC721 token which can be exchanged freely on the MetrixCoin blockchain.
Ownership of PYRO tokens grants access to interact with the pyro which are tied to them.

## **How do you get a Pyro?**

You can bid on auctioned Pyros using the built in [auctions](/website/auction), or any other DEX which supports MRC721 assets.

You can generate a Generation 0 pyro through the [web](/category/pyropets-website) dapp, or through interacting with the contract directly.

In order to generate a Generation 0 Pyro a fee of 100,000 MRX must be paid to the core contract which is then burned.

## **What can you do with a pyro?**

The core version of PyroPets allows for generating, customizing, stoking(breeding), playing with, feeding and auctioning Pyros.

Playing with Pyros generates Embers [(MBRS)](/tokens/mbrs), the native MRC20 token used to pay for customizations provided by the core contracts.

Pyros can be burned in order to gather Embers from unwanted Pyros.

There are planned extenstions for PyroPets that will increase the functionality of the PyroPets tokens, and since PyroPets is open-source and extensible, any developer can choose to extend and use Pyros or Embers in their project.

## **How many different Pyros are there?**

[![pyros.png](/img/pyros.png)](/img/pyros-5120.png)

There are 32 sets of eyes and 32 snouts. This means there are 1,024 different combinations for Gen 0 Pyros. Since there can only ever be 16,384 Gen 0 Pyros, this means if all traits are equally distributed each Gen 0 Pyro would be 1 of 16, but due to the fact that this distribution may not be equal, certain traits may be more or less rare than others.

Pyro offspring get their traits from their donors. This means that there can be multiple Pyros that look the same, but have different ID and parents.

Pyro colors can be customized using MBRS.

Pyro names can be customized using MBRS.

## **How many Pyros exist?**

There is no limit on the amount of PyroPets that can exist, however there is a hard limit of 16,384 Generation 0 Pyros.

## **Generations**

There is no limit of generations, each generation has different **PyroGenesisCost**, **cooldown** you need to wait, and they generate different **MBRS**, you can check the information in the following table

- Generations 13+, have the same statistics as generation 13
