# PyroPets

PyroPets [(PYRO)](/tokens/pyro) is an extensible, deflationary, completely open-source permanent MRC721 NFT collectable game deployed on the MetrixCoin blockchain.

PyroPets uses [MetriMask](/metrimask) and PyroPets [website](/category/pyropets-website) to interact and safely transfer the [PYRO](/tokens/pyro) token

- **Extensible** because due to the nature of MRC721 tokens and smart contracts in general, developers may extend PyroPets in a permissionless way. Embers [(MBRS)](/tokens/mbrs) the native MRC20 token to PyroPets, may also be used in other projects if developers wish.
- **Deflationary** because 100% of PYRO generation fees (Gen0 and stoking) is burned. MBRS in addition to being created by playing with a Pyro, may also be created in a ratio of 1 MBRS : 1000 MRX and are burned in order to perform customizations or feed your Pyro.
- **Source code** of project to be made available soon!
- **Contract source** is available on [contracts](/contracts) page.
